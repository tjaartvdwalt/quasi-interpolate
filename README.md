Quasi Interpolate
=================
This is an implementation of the Quasi Interpolate algorithm as defined in the text book [MATHEMATICS OF APPROXIMATION](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Approximation-Textbooks-Science-Engineering/dp/949121649X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378235841&sr=8-1&keywords=MATHEMATICS+OF+APPROXIMATION+by+Johan+de+Villiers) by Johan de Villiers.

The algorithm is implemented in [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) and you will need to have Sage [installed](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/) in order to run it on your system.

I did not have a the time to nicely package this project. Feel free to contribute!
A quick and dirty way to get the code working is to copy the algorithm (src/quasi_interpolate.py) into your code base. Look at the examples in the test directory for how to use it.
